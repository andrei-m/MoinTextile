h2. Usage

The plugin is enabled on a page-by-page basis using the @#format mointextile@ directive at the top of the page.

h2. Bugs

When adding the @http@ class attribute to external links with no other class specified, this plugin should probably use the same regular expression as Moin in order to decide if a link is internal or external. It currently just looks for links that start with "http".
